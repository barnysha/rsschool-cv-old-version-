## About Myself:
I have an economic education. However, working in sales, I always dreamed of becoming a programmer. 
The Code attracted me and the lack of time for training stopped me. Now it's enough.
I am diligent and like to learn, but I need a mentor to guide me and tell me how to code in real life.


## Skills and Proficiency:

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code, Sublime
* FIGMA


## Code example:

``` 
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function (str) {
  
    str = this.toLowerCase().split(' ');
  
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    str[i] = str[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str[i].substring(1);
    }
  
    return str = str.join(' ');

};

```
